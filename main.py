# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

# Angela's Solution

# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
# Round the result to 2 decimal places.

# print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
# bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
# tip = int(input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
# people = int(input("How many people to split the bill?"))

# tip_as_percent = tip / 100
# total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
# total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
# bill_per_person = total_bill / people
# final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)
